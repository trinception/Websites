# Websites

This is where I keep my portfolio website ideas. When building my website, I had many ideas and wanted to execute all of them. I decided to implement a few and select the strongest as my official site, but keep the code of the others.

Resume-Portfolio is the one I usually use as my professional portfolio. It is meant to be straightforward and practical. The others are experiments in UI/UX features, web design, and backend functionality that I like to tweak to refine my web development skills and explore design concepts in. If there is a feature I find particularly valuable, I try to incorporate it into my official portfolio site, but there are many features I am unable to fit in.

Play-Portfolio is a fun, retro-game inspired design, heavily influenced by my first few years of programming, when I spent a lot of time building small computer games, all of which I have unfortunately lost the code for. I have always enjoyed gaming and growing up I played on various consoles, but I have a particular fondness for the retro-style games I used to play as a kid on my dad's Game Boy. As a result, much of the games I built had a pixelated or "mario"-like feel to them. This site is meant to emulate the aesthetic of these games, and inspire nostalgia and a sense of play.

Design-Portfolio is my interpretation and exploration of various design trends, such as "neumorphism" design, a design trend that was very popular in 2023, and "glassmorphism" design, a supposed trend of 2024. The site is minimalistic and simple, really meant as a way for me to see how different designs play out aesthetically, and whether they would be practical in a professional portfolio.

Apple-Matrix-Portfolio is an exploration of different tech inspired design trends and functionalities. Being named after a movie character from the Matrix, I felt it would be a shame if I didn't at least explore a site concept that plays on the movie concepts and aesthetic.
